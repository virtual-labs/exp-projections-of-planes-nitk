      "question": "If the laminar true shape obtained on VP then",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It is Parallel to HP",
        "b": "It is parallel to VP",
        "c": " Perpendicular to HP",
        "d": " Both B & C"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (d). When the true shape is obtained on HP, it means that we are projecting the features of the object onto a plane parallel to VP. Since VP is also perpendicular to HP, it won't be parallel to HP",
        "b": "The right answer is (d). When the true shape is obtained on VP, it means that we are projecting the features of the object onto a plane parallel to VP. Since VP is Vertical, the true shape lies in a vertical plane. But it is also perpendicular to HP.",
        "c": "The right answer is (d). When the true shape is obtained on VP, it means that we are projecting the features of the object onto a plane parallel to VP and perpendicular to HP.",
        "d": "Correct, the right answer is (d). When the true shape is obtained on VP, it means that we are projecting the features of the object onto a plane parallel to VP. Since VP is vertical, the true shape lies in a vertical plane. Additionally, because the vertical plane is perpendicular to HP, it ensures accurate representation without any perspective distortion."
