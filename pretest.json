        "a": "The rigth answer is (b). A plane can be perpendicular to both HP and VP. Example consider PP, it is perpendicular to both HP and VP.",
        "b": "Correct, the rigth answer is (b). A plane cannot be parallel to both HP and VP as both the planes are perpendicular to each other. Either it can parallel to HP or VP but not both.",
        "c": "The rigth answer is (b). Yes, a plane can be perpendicular to HP and parallel to VP.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (d). HP is used to show the front view or top view of the plane, not the true shape. The true shape of oblique plane will be obtained in Secondary auxillary view.",
        "b": "The right answer is (d). VP is used to show the front view or top view of the plane, not the true shape. The true shape of oblique plane will be obtained in Secondary auxillary view.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (d). When the true shape is obtained on HP, it means that we are projecting the features of the object onto a plane parallel to HP. Since HP is horizontal, the true shape lies in a horizontal plane. But it is also perpendicular to VP.",
        "b": "The right answer is (d). When the true shape is obtained on HP, it means that we are projecting the features of the object onto a plane parallel to HP. Since it is also perpendicular to VP, it won't be parallel to VP",
        "c": "The right answer is (d). When the true shape is obtained on HP, it means that we are projecting the features of the object onto a plane parallel to HP and perpendicular to VP.",
        "d": "Correct, the right answer is (d). When the true shape is obtained on HP, it means that we are projecting the features of the object onto a plane parallel to HP. Since HP is horizontal, the true shape lies in a horizontal plane. Additionally, because the horizontal plane is perpendicular to VP, it ensures accurate representation without any perspective distortion."
